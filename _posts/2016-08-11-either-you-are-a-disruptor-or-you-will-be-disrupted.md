Either you are a disruptor or you will be disrupted.

Is this true? 

It is if you believe your industry is not prepared to experience change.

In that sense, the status quo is no longer acceptable. Technology is influencing every facets of industry, from emerging to entrenched and well established spaces.

The original theory of disruption, now known as new market disruption, was detailed in Christensen's seminal paper and expanded on in The Innovators Dilemma. 

This is well described in a very instructive video by Board Studios:

Based primarily on a detailed study of the hard drive or rather disk drive industry, the theory of new market disruption described how incumbent companies ignore new technologies that don't serve the needs of their customers or fit within their existing business models. However, as the new technology, which excels on completely different attributes than the incumbent's product, continues to mature, it eventually takes over the market.

That being said, this shouldn't be taken as religion. What Clayton Christensen claimed in his Theory of Low-End Disruption back over a decade has been challenged as of late.
